# Kanban Board
This is a very simple Kanban Board build on top of Blazor (wasm), gRPC and RavenDB

It should show how Drag&Drop, Blazor Component Unit Testing work and how all the technologies come together.

# Setup
To make it run just start the `LinkDotNet.KanbanBoard.Web` project and the `LinkDotNet.KanbanBoard.UI` project.
Furthermore you need a running RavenDb-Instance. There should be a database already created. The name of the database is defined in the appsettings.json.
